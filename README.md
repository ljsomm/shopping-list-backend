## Shopping List - Backend ðŸ“”

On this project it's possible to see the Shopping List application Rest API. I'm glad to say that I could use the two most famous principles to organize and keep loosely coupled code (DDD + Hexagonal Architecture). I also tried to follow Go's horizontal code naming, so to the root directories I used the DDD Layered naming and for the files I used the Hexagonal Architecture division.
